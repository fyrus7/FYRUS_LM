- Aperture: f/1.0 to f/22.0
- Shutter: 1/10000 to 133 sec.
- ISO: 8 - 4 000 000



# What you need:

1. Arduino Nano.

2. 0.96" Oled Display.

3. BH1750FVI Light Sensor with Dome.
 - ( Minor change in code if you use BH1750 without dome)

4. TCS34725 RGB Sensor.

5. Tactile Button.

6. AAA Battery case (for 2 battery).

Optional, (i use it)

7. 3.7v Lipo Battery.

8. 5v Step-Up converter (to convert 3.7v to 5v).

9. Usb/Type-C charger for Lipo battery.

10. Electronic enclosure case.


# to do :
- (i failed this due to the lack of knowledge)

- if anyone got the idea please update the code

- one tactile & one rotary switch with push button.

1. Instead of 6 button, make one button for metering.
2. add a rotary switch with push button to control,
- plus.
- minus.
- single click to switch between aperture/shutter priority.
- double click to enter iso setting.
- long press to switch between ambient/flash mode.
