# FYRUS LM / Arduino Photography Light Meter
Incident Light Meter &amp; White Balance for Photography


# Highlite

1. Aperture Priority.
2. Shutter Priority.
3. Flash Mode.
4. ND Filter Mode.
5. Temperature Reading (White Balance).
6. EV Reading.
7. Battery Reading

- Aperture: f/1.0 to f/22.0
- Shutter: 1/10000 to 133 sec.
- ISO: 8 - 4 000 000



# What you need:

1. Arduino Nano v3

2. 128x64 (0.96) Oled Display.
- 4 pin or 7 pin (SPI) display both can use.
- i have write the code for 7 pin. Just follow instructions in the note.


3. BH1750 / BH1750FVI Light Sensor.
- (GY-30 & GY-302 are same, just different in their size)

4. TCS34725 RGB Sensor.

5. 6x Tactile Button.

6. Lipo 1S 3.7v Battery.

7. (optional) Electronic enclosure case.

# to do :
- (i failed this due to the lack of knowledge)
- if anyone got the idea please update the code

- one tactile & one rotary switch with push button.

1. Instead of 6 button, make...
- ONE Tactile Button for Metering
- ONE (EC11) Rotary Switch with Push Button

2. Rotary Switch to control...
- plus.
- minus.
- single click to switch between aperture/shutter priority.
- double click to enter ISO/ND setting.
- long press to switch between Ambient/Flash mode.
